==============================================================================
1. User-defined text objects                            *textobj-def*

    ae                                                  *v_ae*  *aw*
                        "an entire text", select the entire text.

    ai                                                  *v_ai*  *ai*
                        "an indented block", select the lines in the same or
                        deeper indent level with a single line of the
                        shallower indent level on each side. It is useful to
                        select a block like "for ... endfor" in vimscript.

    ii                                                  *v_ii*  *ii*
                        "inner indent", select the lines in the same or deeper
                        indent level. It is useful when combined with 'zf' and
                        'gc'. "zfii" will fold inside the indented block, and
                        "gcii" will comment out it.

    af                                                  *v_af*  *af*
                        "a function", select the indented lines with one
                        non-indented line on each side. It won't include the
                        comment or empty line.

    if                                                  *v_if*  *if*
                        "inner function", select the indented lines inside the
                        non-indented lines. It is useful when combined with
                        '>'. ">if" will indent inside the non-indented 
                        function.

    a|                                                  *v_a-bar*  *a-bar*
                        "a string" surrounded by "|", select the string in the
                        line which is surrounded by "|" and also the "|"
                        character on both sides. It is useful when editing a 
                        tag like |textobj|.
                        Note: this may not behave as you expected when there
                        are multiple "|" in the line. The implementation tends
                        to select the surrounded string before "|" when the
                        cursor is on it. Try it out on the next line. >
                            | This line | is | for | testing. |   |
<
    i|                                                  *v_i-bar*  *i-bar*
                        "inner string" surrounded by "|", select the string in
                        the line which is surrounded by "|". It is useful when
                        editing a tag like |textobj|.
                        This is also like 'a|', tends to select the string 
                        before the "|" when the cursor is on it. See |v_a-bar|
                        for the boundary behavior.
    
    a*                                                  *v_a-star* *a-star*
                        "a string" surrounded by "*", select the string in the
                        line which is surrounded by "*" and also the "*"
                        character on both sides. It is useful when editing a
                        tag like *a-star-example* . 
                        See |v_a-bar| for the boundary behavior.

    i*                                                  *v_i-star*  *i-star*
                        "inner string" surrounded by "*", select the string in
                        the line which is surrounded by "*". It is useful when
                        editing a tag like *i-star-example* .
                        See |v_a-bar| for the boundary behavior.

    ic
                        "inner comment", select a block of lines begin with
                        commenting character. This works the same as "ac".

    ac
                        "a comment", same as "ic".
