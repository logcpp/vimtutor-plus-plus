1. How to use Drag mode                                 *dragmode-usage*

In some cases, you want to move some codes around in a program. This plugin
makes it easier to do it. Map <plug>(dragmode-n) and <plug>(dragmode-v) to the
key you like and press the key, this will start the dragging mode and you can
use 'j' and 'k' to move the code around.

To select multiple lines to drag, see the more specific description in the
next section: |dragmode-cmd|
