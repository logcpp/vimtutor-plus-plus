PLUGIN - FOLDMODE -                                *foldmode* *Plugin-Foldmode*

This plugin is made for quick navigation on foldings by toggling 'z' key in
the default key mappings. (See |folds|)

For example, 'j' will be mapped to 'zj', to move the cursor to the next 
folding. This will make a whole new set of key bindings, which could be 
expressed as making a "pesudo Fold mode". You can get into the "Fold" mode by 
mapping the key you like to the <plug>(foldmode-on) key.

1. Foldmode on                                          |foldmode-on|
2. Foldmode off                                         |foldmode-off|

1. Foldmode on                                          *foldmode-on*

Turning on the "Fold" mode can be done by pressing the key mapped to
<plug>(foldmode-on). This will call the foldmode#Foldon() defined in the
autoload/foldmode.vim.

In this function, the commands used to manipulate foldings are remapped. For
example, the command 'za' is used to open a folding, so it will be remapped to
'a'. And for the consistency of the commands, 'a' will be mapped to 'za' at
the same time, so that users can still use the 'append' command.

Here is a full list of the command remappings involved to this plugin.

        f -> zf    F -> zF            zf -> f    zF -> F
        d -> zd    D -> zD            zd -> d    zD -> D
        o -> zo    E -> zE            zo -> o    zE -> E
        c -> zc    O -> zO            zc -> c    zO -> O
        a -> za    C -> zC            za -> a    zC -> C
        v -> zv    A -> zA            zv -> v    zA -> A
        x -> zx    X -> zX            zx -> x    zX -> X
        m -> zm    M -> zM            zm -> m    zM -> M
        r -> zr    R -> zR            zr -> r    zR -> R
        n -> zn    N -> zN            zn -> n    zN -> N
        i -> zi                       zi -> i
        j -> zjzz                     zj -> j
        k -> zkzz                     zk -> k
        <Esc> -> Foldoff()            <Esc> -> <Esc>

Note: Foldoff() function is defined in the autoload/foldmode.vim. This is
explained in the next section.

==============================================================================
2. Foldmode off                                         *foldmode-off*

To turn the "Fold" mode off, just press '<Esc>' in it. This is mapped to the
Foldoff() function defined in script-scope in the autoload/foldmode.vim. When
Foldoff() is called, the mappings modified by the foldmode#Foldon() will be
reset, so that users can "return" to the default Normal mode.

Note that getting out of the "Fold" mode will reset all used key mappings to
the Vim default key mappings, so customized mappings involve with the command
listed above will be destroyed!
