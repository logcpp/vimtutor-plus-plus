# Why I like Vim

Vim is powerful, but hard to use?
Here are the reasons why I prefer Vim to other editors.


## Keyboard Based Interface

Keyboards: many keys, infinite combinations, absolute input

Mouse: 3-5 "keys" (?), limited combinations, ambiguous input

## Repetition Ability

Vim can repeat all kinds of process in editing,
such as delete, copy & paste, and macros

## Regex Supported Search and Substitution

Vim can search & substitute all patterns that can be described
in regular expression.

## Handling Multiple Files

Vim can edit multiple files simultaneously. ('argdo', 'bufdo')

## Synagy with Shell/Commandline

Vim can execute external commands while editing. Vim can also
give the content of the editing file to any external programs,
and get the output back to the file buffer.

## Nearly Infinite Extensibility

Vim provides full control of all its settings and functionalities
to users, so that they can redefine or combine the functionalities
to make a new feature.

This enables users to create plugins and vimscripts to realize 
any features they want to implement into their own Vim.

## Comprehensive Documentation

Last but not least, Vim has a complete documentation by 
Bram Moolenaar, the author of Vim. It is written carefully and 
easy to read, providing all information you need to know to use 
Vim properly. The help files are your friends when you get into 
troubles.

## Conclusion

Vim is so powerful that theoretically there is nothing Vim cannot do.
However, due to the powerfulness, Vim is not easy to learn and use.
Users are required to keep memorizing all kinds of commands for 
editing files and write vimscripts.

But hey, think this way. We're still beginners of computing, so we 
have plenty of time to dedicate to learning Vim. Considering that in 
the future we will write much more programs then we have written,
why not choose Vim as a partner of coding in the rest of your life?
